## Abstract

Tracking mitochondria in cellular images is crucial for understanding their dynamics, morphology, and roles in diseases. Advanced segmentation models like U-Net and SAM are commonly used to enhance accuracy and efficiency in these tasks. This project aims to develop a robust system for detecting and tracking objects in scientific images. The focus is on comparing U-Net and SAM models to determine which performs better in terms of accuracy and speed. Using machine vision techniques, we will apply masks to images, analyze the results, and compare their performance.

## Abstract

Tracking mitochondria in cellular images is crucial for understanding their dynamics, morphology, and roles in diseases. Advanced segmentation models like
U-Net and SAM are commonly used to enhance accuracy and efficiency in these tasks.
This project aims to develop a robust system for detecting and tracking objects in scientific images. The focus is on comparing U-Net and SAM models to determine which performs better in terms of accuracy and speed. Using machine
vision techniques, we will apply masks to images, analyze the results, and compare their performance.



## Applications

The use of mitochondrial tracking and detection technology, employing models like U-Net, provides significant support to medical practitioners across various
medical domains.
1. Disease Diagnosis Linked to Mitochondria: Precise identification of mitochondria aids in early detection of mitochondrial-related diseases, enabling timely and appropriate treatment.
2. Therapy Monitoring: Mitochondrial detection allows healthcare professionals to monitor the efficacy of different treatments, ensuring continuous improvement in patient care.
3. Research and Drug Development: A deeper understanding of mitochondrial status and function supports medical research, fostering the development of novel drugs and therapeutic approaches.

By utilizing mitochondrial detection through models like U-Net, medical practitioners can enhance disease diagnosis, treatment, and cellular health monitoring effectively.
